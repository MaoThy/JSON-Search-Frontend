# JSON-Search-Frontend
This is an interface for displaying information from an array of JSON objects. It includes a search function that will only display data rows that contain the letters typed in the search bar.

The search function is invoked every time a key is pressed while the search bar is in focus, resulting in a very responsive-feeling interface. The program will load JSON data from an external source (like an API) and then it will use JavaScript to create the table rows. It uses a custom Bootstrap theme and is fully responsive. It also includes a dark theme that can be toggled with a button at the top. A later version will include an exact match function that will only return table rows containing an exact word or phrase, along with a refactor of the code that will make it clearer/more readable.
